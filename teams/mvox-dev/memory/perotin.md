## Repo location — IMPORTANT (2026-08-07)

Two distinct repos are in play:
- `~/workspace` → `mvox-dev/mvox_v4e_web`. Holds `teams/mvox-dev/` config + this scratchpad.
  Legacy/team-infra surface now — my May–early-Aug scripts live here (80 seed-results, 29 probes),
  but this is NOT where current app work happens.
- `~/workspace-app` → `mvox-dev/mvox-app`. **The live app.** `$REPO` for my live seed/probe
  scripts now resolves here (team-lead fixed `teams/mvox-dev/prompts/perotin.md` accordingly,
  commit 603b129). Scratchpad stays at `~/workspace/teams/mvox-dev/memory/perotin.md` (workspace-app
  has no `teams/` dir).
Cross-ref: `~/.claude/projects/-home-ai-teams/memory/mvox-app-slice1-resume-state.md` (team-lead's
auto-memory, authoritative cross-session resume vehicle — read that first, not this file, for
"what's the current state of the app").

## Entu platform mechanics (durable — verified empirically, cite findings docs for detail)

**Two DELETE endpoints, never interchangeable**: entity `_id` (incl. prop-def entities) →
`DELETE /entity/{id}`. Property-VALUE `_id` (one of a multi-valued property's values) →
`DELETE /property/{id}`. Conflating them caused two real bugs historically (Phase B v12, #56).

**POST APPENDS, never replaces.** All non-formula string/reference/boolean properties are
implicitly multi-valued. Replace semantics = DELETE existing value `_id`(s) first, then POST.
Applies to `_sharing`, `_inheritrights`, boolean flags, everything non-formula.

**CREATE requires explicit `_type`**: `{type:'_type', reference:'<type-entity-id>'}` in the POST
body — omitting it is a 400, and CREATE has no dry-run-visible failure mode (only surfaces live).

**Formula properties**: no `_id` on their value (virtual/computed). Cannot be directly written —
Entu accepts the POST (200) but immediately re-evaluates and silently overwrites. Materialized
formula values PERSIST after their SOURCE property is deleted (not recomputed on read) — re-eval
only fires on (a) prop-def formula-expression change, (b) any non-formula POST on the instance
("touch-save"), or (c) a source-prop write. To convert formula→plain: `DELETE /property/{formulaValueId}`
off the **prop-def** entity (not the prop-def itself) — new instances become plain-writable; a
direct POST cleanly replaces any stale formula-cached value on existing instances (no pre-delete
needed, cached values have no `_id` to collide with).

**`_sharing` create-time materialization**: `inheritParentProperties` auto-copies the PARENT's
`_sharing` onto a new child UNLESS the create payload explicitly sets `_sharing` (explicit wins,
even against a domain/public parent). If parent is private/absent, child gets no `_sharing`
property at all (absent = private). `DELETE /property/{sharingValueId}` leaves it permanently
absent — no async re-materialization from parent on a later read. Type-def `_sharing` is NEVER
copied to instances (checked directly — it's not the source of create-time copy, the immediate
parent ENTITY is).

**`_inheritrights` is a CHILD-side property.** Controls whether that entity inherits rights from
**its own parent**. Absent default = `true` at create. An org's own `_inheritrights:false` blocks
cascade INTO the org from its parent (umbrella/db) — it says nothing about whether the org's
CHILDREN inherit from the org; that's controlled by each child's own `_inheritrights` (sections/
members/agenda nodes are `true` by design, so org `_viewer` grants cascade down through them).
(Session-39 entry corrected an earlier wrong model that had this backwards — this is the settled
version.)

**Rights tiers**: `_editor` grants LIST/GET/POST-props/DELETE-prop-value but NOT `DELETE /entity`
(needs `_owner`) and NOT writes to any `rightType` property (`_noaccess/_viewer/_expander/_editor/
_owner/_sharing/_inheritrights` — all need `_owner`). Auto-provisioned persons
(`createUserForAccount`) get `_editor:self` only, never `_owner:self` — they can never write
`_sharing` on their own person via that path. No per-VALUE `_sharing` override exists anywhere —
domain/public bucket membership is uniform per prop-def across every instance of a type; per-record
field visibility is structurally unrepresentable today.

**CREATE has NO parent-rights check, for anyone, ever.** `routes/[db]/entity/index.post.js` only
gates on `entu.user` existing; `checkEntityAccess` no-ops when `entityId` is undefined (i.e. on
create); `inheritParentProperties` reads the parent's `_sharing`/`_inheritrights` via a direct Mongo
query, bypassing rights entirely. v4E schema's `creators: CreatorRule[]` (self/system/cron/
parent_right/bilateral/custom) is DESIGN-DOCUMENTATION ONLY — zero entu-api enforcement. The
README's repeated "BFF creates the member" language implies these rules were always meant to be
enforced by a server component mvox (browser-direct, no BFF) doesn't have. Findings:
`docs/migration/findings/invitation-member-creation-rights-2026-08-06.md`.

**`add_user` vs `invitation` — two unrelated mechanisms.** `add_user` (private prop on the db
entity) gates `createUserForAccount`: on first-time OAuth sign-in with no existing `accounts`
match, auto-provisions a new `person` as a child of `add_user.reference`. `invite=` query param on
the SAME `/auth` endpoint is a totally different path (re-links real OAuth creds to a
PRE-EXISTING entity via a server-minted 7d JWT stored as a property) — presence of `invite=` alone
(regardless of validity) SKIPS the auto-create branch. v4E's `invitation` entity is a third, separate
thing (app-level bilateral-consent design, zero platform enforcement — see above). `add_user` was
permanently DELETED 2026-08-06T13:13:47Z (task #22/T4.1) — polyphony's OAuth auto-provisioning
window is now closed; no new person can be created via plain OAuth sign-in until a replacement lands.

**API key vs JWT**: `entu_api_key` is permanent (SHA-256 hash on a person entity, no auto-expiry,
rotated only by overwrite). JWT minted from it is 48h, IP-bound via `aud` claim (mismatched egress
IP = silent 401). An `entu_api_key` on a person with NO OAuth account always returns an anonymous
floor JWT (`accounts:{}`) — the key is not identity-linked, cannot synthesize a real member JWT.
Real cross-user rights testing requires an actual second OAuth login (confirmed working method,
session 37).

**Pagination/search**: list envelope is always `{entities, count, limit, skip}` — `count` is total
corpus size, `skip`+`limit` is the only mechanism (no cursor, no observed cap to `limit=500`).
`name.string=X` = exact case-sensitive NFC match (correct for FK lookups). `q=X` = case-insensitive
substring across all string props.

**File properties**: two-step (`POST` announce with ALL of `filename`/`filesize`/`filetype`
required — omit any and you get a silent empty-shell property with no upload field — then `PUT` to
a DigitalOcean Spaces S3-compatible signed URL, 60s TTL, no retry). Required S3 headers: ACL,
Content-Disposition, Content-Type; do NOT set Content-Length explicitly. `DELETE /property/{id}`
does NOT delete the S3 object (confirmed orphan) — Spaces cleanup isn't implemented anywhere in
entu-api. `_thumbnail` = signed download URL for `photo[0]`, no resize pipeline, same 60s TTL.
Findings: `docs/migration/findings/file-property-wire-shape-2026-05-23.md`.

**`mandatory:true`** on a prop-def is a UI hint only — checked `entu-api` source directly, never
enforced server-side on create or update. Order-of-operations for schema/code changes doesn't need
to wait on it.

**Formula-as-rights-bypass** (useful pattern): `_referrer.<type>.<prop> COUNT` and sentinel-reference
+ per-value COUNT formulas both read across rights boundaries — safe for AGGREGATES (tallies,
counts) even when the underlying records are private; never project raw values this way (leaks).
Arithmetic operators on formula-derived values are broken (string-concat instead of math) — use
separate COUNT formulas for totals, never `*`/`+` on a formula output. Single-hop traversal only.

**Bucket exposure is a 3-gate AND, not just the entity's own `_sharing`.** A property value reaches
a non-owner reader only if ALL THREE hold: (1) the PROP-DEF's own `_sharing` (uniform per type,
established above), (2) the TYPE entity's own `_sharing` — a CAP (`aggregate.js:94/115`: if the type
has no `_sharing` at all, it nukes domain/public exposure for EVERY prop-def on that type regardless
of gate 1), (3) the INSTANCE's own `_sharing`. Missing gate 2 is an easy-to-miss apparent-success
trap: a script can "successfully" set gate 1 and still change nothing. Always read-verify gate 2
live before trusting gate-1-only fixes (real incident: #20/mvox-app, 2026-08-07 — `member.person`/
`member.section` prop-defs had no `_sharing`; fixed by setting both to `domain`, but the fix also
needed a live check that `member`'s TYPE entity itself was already `domain`, which it was).

**Buckets are write-time SNAPSHOTS, not read-time computed** (`aggregate.js` runs `aggregateEntity`
on every write, materializing `private`/`domain`/`public` onto the stored document). A prop-def
`_sharing` fix does NOT retroactively fix any already-aggregated instance — every existing instance
needs a genuine re-write (touch-save: atomic single `POST entity/{id}` carrying an existing
property's own `_id` + its own value, re-asserting not changing it — `insertProperties` soft-deletes
+ re-inserts in one call, zero multi-value risk) to pick up the new bucket assignment. New instances
created AFTER the prop-def fix get it for free. Cross-ref `docs/architecture/entu-rights-and-
visibility-model.md` §1/§3 (mvox-app) for the full source citations.

**Artifact hygiene during iterative script fixes**: don't leave multiple near-identical dry-run
artifacts committed while a script is still being revised pre-authorization — team-lead's review
picked up a stale one instead of the current one this session (real confusion, real time cost).
Delete superseded pre-authorization dry-run artifacts as you go (they're draft churn, not audit
history yet); keep exactly one current one until the live run lands its own artifact.

## Seed / probe script catalog (current, both repos)

**`~/workspace` (mvox_v4e_web) — legacy, stable, not actively extended:**
seed-voices.ts · seed-collectives.ts (120p/235m/6o/16s) · seed-po-member-ekf.ts ·
seed-librarian-bundle-data.ts (CHORE-60 EPCC library subtree) · seed-menu-items-per-entity-type ·
seed-rsvp-tally-prop-defs (rsvp/event formula tally props) · seed-mvox-collective-marker (app-ext
type, PO-approved, not canonical v4E) · cleanup-menu-usability · cleanup-rename-photo-prop-def-only ·
cleanup-fila-hooaeg-end-date · cleanup-mvox-collective-test-hidden · Phase B/C/D cleanup scripts
(migration body of work, complete — polyphony is v4E-schema-aligned as of Phase C/D closeout).
perotin-toolkit.ts: `isDryRun()`, `writeResultArtifact()`, `replaceProperty()`, `findOrCreateByName()`
— consumes Josquin's `lib/entu-client.ts` primitives, doesn't duplicate.

**`~/workspace-app` (mvox-app) — active:**
t3-1-provision-singers-2026-08-07.ts + lib/t3-1-singer-provision.ts (T3.1 bundles 1+2: 128 domain
profiles + 128 tier conversions, live 2026-08-07, reconstructed artifact
`seed-results/t3-1-bundles-1-2-3-reconstructed-2026-08-07T10-46-51-000Z.json`) ·

cleanup-t4-3-profile-type-person-reduction-2026-08-06.ts (both of these two are recorded in THIS
repo's history per my own scratchpad, but team-lead's audit found `git log --all` on workspace-app
shows no trace — treat as workspace-app-absent until re-confirmed; don't hunt for files that aren't
there). **workspace-app's `seed-results/`+`probes/` dirs did not exist before 2026-08-07** — going
forward, every live workspace-app run gets a committed artifact via the same toolkit pattern (port
`perotin-toolkit.ts` over if/when a second script needs it — not yet extracted there).
widen-member-refs-2026-08-07.ts + lib/widen-member-refs-2026-08-07.ts + .spec.ts (#20 fix: 2
prop-def `_sharing` writes + 245-member touch-save sweep, live 2026-08-07, result artifact
`seed-results/widen-member-refs-2026-08-07-live-2026-08-07T15-24-56-647Z.json`). Has a
`BASELINE_DOMAIN_MEMBER_IDS` frozen-set drift-check (245 ids) — reusable pattern for any future
script needing to disambiguate "population changed" from "count happens to match."

## Privacy boundary register

- Estonian choir names (EFK/Sireen/Rahvusmeeskoor/TAM/EKBL/EMKL) — real, publicly-associated,
  acceptable per architecture-decisions.md.
- Seed persons — synthesized Estonian-style names, no real PII, `@example.ee` domain where emails set.
- polyphony is confirmed SYNTHETIC end-to-end (PO 2026-08-05: "no real data in Entu; import is
  last") — supersedes an earlier stale "production-shaped, 116 real members" line in
  architecture-decisions.md (not mine to edit, flagged only).
- Real persons IN the db: db-root/PO (`69bcfd8e...8079`), Mihkel's own OAuth-domain identity
  (`6a2fc05e...5ddc`), Test User (`6a097dcc...d6dd`, no OAuth link, pre-add_user-reversibility
  fixture), fixture "B" (`6a7591cc...8de`, real T4.9-walkthrough OAuth signup). All real,
  team-owned, out of the synthetic-seed population.

## Authorization gate — canonical statement (cross-ref `[[feedback_authorization_gate]]`)

Explicit inbound `"I authorize this run"` SendMessage **from team-lead** is the only valid gate —
not dry-run-clean, not Bentham GREEN, not task-assignment wording that merely states authorization
happened elsewhere, not a prior categorical "go ahead" covering a DIFFERENT script than the one
about to execute. Content AND routing (`from: team-lead`) both must check out. Re-verify per new
script/target-set even under a standing "go ahead," since a live write can hit a corner neither
dry-run nor code review caught — this has happened for real, more than once (Phase D sub-op 1
briefly nulled PO's name; T4.10 caught two separate real conflicts across two independent dry-run+
verify rounds that never went live). If >15 min pass past an expected authorization, send a status
ping — never self-authorize.

## Currently deferred / not scheduled

- **115 legacy orphan `member` rows** (no `person` ref, no `status`, carry raw `name` strings) —
  bundle-3's prop-def removal never purges existing values by design. PO-owned disposition
  question, unscoped, not scheduled.
- **T4.10 (#30) profile migration** — CLOSED superseded 2026-08-07, never ran live. Mihkel ruled:
  don't run it; the one real target's data was already re-established via the shipped profile-edit
  UI (T4.6). Zero migration writes across the whole arc.
- **#9 (T4.8 EntuUser.name prefill)** — Mihkel-blocked per team-lead's 2026-08-07 checkpoint, not
  data-manager work.
- **#20 last-mile** — the rights-narrowing gap itself (below) is fixed + live-verified by db-root.
  What's left is Mihkel's real-browser confirmation that a genuine non-owner domain reader now sees
  `person`/`section` on a member — db-root can never observe this (always reads private bucket).
- **entu_api_key requires `_owner` (not just `_editor`)** on live api.entu.app — confirmed by direct
  reproduction 2026-08-05, contradicts the local `~/projects/entu-api` clone's `checkEntityAccess`
  `rightTypes` list (no `entu_api_key` entry there). Live/local source drift, unresolved — no
  credential I hold can fix it (only an existing `_owner` can grant `_owner`, circular). Needs PO to
  grant `_owner` directly via Entu UI or a fresh OAuth login on the affected reader person.
- **`lib/v4e-translator.ts` `translatePropertyDef`** never sets `_sharing` on new prop-def entities
  (checked function body) — harmless today (parent type has no `_sharing` on the affected census),
  would silently under-share future prop-defs under a shared parent type. Flagged to Josquin, not
  mine to fix (lib is his territory).

## Recent session — 2026-08-07 (T3.1 #17, full arc)

Probed member/roster population split: 130 clean v4E members (person ref + status, no `name`) vs
115 orphan legacy members (no person ref/status, DO carry `name` — pre-v2-rewrite leftover never
deleted). Confirmed `member.name` is still written by the CURRENT shipped invite code
(`inviteData.ts`), not just legacy debt — motivated bundle 3's schema mutation. Ran T3.1 bundles
1+2+3 live (see catalog above): 128 domain profiles created, 128 members private→domain, `name`
prop-def removed from `member` type. All three independently re-verified against fresh live reads
(not the scripts' own read-backs) — zero mismatches, zero out-of-scope entities touched. Full
result artifact reconstructed + committed 2026-08-07 (see catalog). T4.10 profile-migration arc
ran two dry-runs (3-person plan, then 2-person post-exclusion), caught two real conflicts via
team-lead's independent verify each time (db-root visibility change; OAUTH's pre-existing
conflicting profile), never went live — Mihkel closed it superseded. Confirmed via direct
`entu-api` source read: `mandatory` is never enforced (see mechanics section above).

## Recent session — 2026-08-07 continued (#20 roster rights-narrowing fix)

Diagnosed + fixed the live "roster crash on legacy orphan members" incident (mvox-app#20/#18).
Root cause was NOT person-entity tier (red herring team-lead initially proposed) — it was
`member.person`/`member.section` prop-defs carrying no `_sharing` (see 3-gate-AND mechanics entry
above). Also caught an identical twin bug on `member.section` before it became its own incident.
Bentham pre-execution review (YELLOW-A: missing type-level-sharing guard, closed) + Gama's 3
chain-text requirements (observed-value ledger, disambiguated 245-population with baseline-set
drift-check, orphan-section-visibility stated as intended) all folded in before authorization.
Live executed 2026-08-07, 245/245 touched, 0 failures, independently re-verified against fresh
reads (rotated property `_id`s matched the ledger exactly). Real process lesson this session:
left 3 near-duplicate dry-run artifacts committed mid-fix, caused a genuine review mix-up — cleaned
up + captured as a durable habit above.
