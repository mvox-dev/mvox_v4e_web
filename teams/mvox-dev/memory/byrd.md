## [CHECKPOINT] 2026-05-20 — CHORE-2 GREEN complete

[LEARNED] Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color space for its palette. Chromium reports colors as `oklch(...)` not `rgb(...)`. Tallis's original test had `rgb(59, 130, 246)` for `text-blue-500` — he corrected it to `oklch(0.623 0.214 259.815)` at commit `2674068`. Future color assertions in Playwright must use OKLCH values.

[LEARNED] Playwright config uses `pnpm preview` (not dev server). Tests run against a built artifact. Must run `pnpm build` before `pnpm exec playwright test` when changes are unstaged/uncommitted, otherwise stale build is served.

[LEARNED] Tailwind v4 CSS-first setup: `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/app.css`, `@tailwindcss/vite` in `vite.config.ts` plugins — no `tailwind.config.js`. Plugin order: tailwindcss before sveltekit.

[DEFERRED] CHORE-2 is pending Bentham review (GREEN handed off, branch `feat/chore-2-tailwind-v4` HEAD `ff37268`). After Bentham GREEN, Josquin merges.

## [CHECKPOINT] 2026-05-21 — CHORE-3 GREEN complete (session 11)

[LEARNED] `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit@0.16.1` is deprecated (use paraglide-js v2 directly) but the team is using it per the AC spec. Vite plugin import: `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit/vite`, call: `paraglide({ project: './project.inlang', outdir: './src/lib/paraglide' })`. Plugin added between tailwindcss() and sveltekit() in vite.config.ts.

[LEARNED] `project.inlang/settings.json` needs: `$schema`, `sourceLanguageTag`, `languageTags`, `modules` (CDN URLs for message-format + m-function-matcher plugins), and `"plugin.inlang.messageFormat": { "pathPattern": "./messages/{languageTag}.json" }`. Build also auto-generates `project.inlang/project_id` and `project.inlang/.gitignore` (ignores `cache/`) — both should be committed.

[LEARNED] Paraglide only compiles when locale files have actual keys. Empty `{}` files → "No messages found - Skipping compilation" → `src/lib/paraglide/` not generated. Expected — Comenius adds keys in i18n phase.

[LEARNED] vitest.config.ts merge pattern: bare `vitest/config` has no Svelte transform. When a spec does `import('@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit')` it pulls in `ParaglideJS.svelte` and throws `Unknown file extension ".svelte"`. Fix: `mergeConfig(viteConfig, defineConfig({test:{...}}))` from `vitest/config` — picks up `sveltekit()` and all Vite plugins. This is the standard SvelteKit+Vitest pattern.

[DEFERRED] CHORE-3 handed off to Comenius for i18n phase (add starter message keys). Branch `feat/chore-3-paraglide` HEAD `df4b9b2`. Bentham review pending after Comenius completes.
