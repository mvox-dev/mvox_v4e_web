## [CHECKPOINT] 2026-05-20 — CHORE-2 GREEN complete

[LEARNED] Tailwind v4 uses OKLCH color space for its palette. Chromium reports colors as `oklch(...)` not `rgb(...)`. Tallis's original test had `rgb(59, 130, 246)` for `text-blue-500` — he corrected it to `oklch(0.623 0.214 259.815)` at commit `2674068`. Future color assertions in Playwright must use OKLCH values.

[LEARNED] Playwright config uses `pnpm preview` (not dev server). Tests run against a built artifact. Must run `pnpm build` before `pnpm exec playwright test` when changes are unstaged/uncommitted, otherwise stale build is served.

[LEARNED] Tailwind v4 CSS-first setup: `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/app.css`, `@tailwindcss/vite` in `vite.config.ts` plugins — no `tailwind.config.js`. Plugin order: tailwindcss before sveltekit.

[DEFERRED] CHORE-2 is pending Bentham review (GREEN handed off, branch `feat/chore-2-tailwind-v4` HEAD `ff37268`). After Bentham GREEN, Josquin merges.
